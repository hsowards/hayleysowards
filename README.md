# Hayley Sowards' Personal Website

## About

This is a personal website I've created for myself in preparation for my transition to a PhD program. My plans for this website include hosting my CV, bibliography, presentations, and a blog that I hope to get in the swing of working on eventually!

## How did I do this?

This website was created using the guidance of [Yihui Xie's book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the R package [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown)

## Theme

I used the [Hugo Goa Theme](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa) by [@shenoybr](https://github.com/shenoybr) for this website.
