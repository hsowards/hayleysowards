Hayley Sowards is currently a postbaccalaureate fellow doing post-GWAS functional analysis of melanoma risk variants. While she is currently working on cancer genomics, her broad research interests are the genetic and environmental variables that are related to the development of psychopathologies in children and adolescents. She is an author on several publications related to this interest, including:

- [Dopamine gene methylation and cognitive performance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15592294.2019.1583032)
- Inflammation gene methylation, parental emotional availability, and health (in press)
- HPA axis gene methylation and harsh parenting (in press)

Outside of her scientific endeavors, Hayley spends her days taking care of her various living things (pictured: Mom, Khaleesi, and Chihiro)
